## 🎤 Interview Narrative Script

**Question:** "Tell me about your projects."

**Answer:**
> "I have two main projects that show different aspects of my skills.
>
> My BACnet project demonstrates backend development and professional engineering practices. I built a Django application for building automation that discovers BACnet devices, collects sensor data, and provides monitoring capabilities. This includes a professional CI pipeline with automated testing, code quality checks, and coverage tracking. It's deployed using Docker and PostgreSQL.
>
> My second project combines my AI/ML graduate background with my 10 years of customer support experience. I built an AI-powered knowledge base using RAG - that's Retrieval Augmented Generation. The frontend is Next.js with TypeScript, and the backend is FastAPI with OpenAI embeddings and a vector database. It's deployed on Vercel and Railway.
>
> What makes this project special is that I understand the problem domain deeply from my customer support background. I know exactly what makes knowledge base search frustrating for support agents, and I used that insight to build a better search experience with AI. The system can answer natural language questions by semantically searching our knowledge base and generating answers with citations.
>
> Both projects are production-deployed with CI/CD pipelines, comprehensive documentation, and live demos I can show you."

**Why This Works:**
- Shows technical breadth (Django, FastAPI, Next.js, TypeScript)
- Demonstrates AI/ML isn't just theoretical (graduate coursework → production)
- Highlights unique advantage (customer support domain expertise)
- Professional practices (CI/CD, deployment, documentation)
- Confident delivery with specifics

---

## 📊 Technology Decision Matrix

### Why TypeScript? ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (MUST LEARN)

**Market Demand:**
- 90% of React/Next.js jobs require TypeScript
- "TypeScript" in job posting = Mid-level expectations, better pay
- Shows you learn modern practices (not stuck in old JavaScript)

**Career Changer Advantage:**
- Type safety = fewer bugs = professional quality code
- Bridges Python backend (typed) to frontend (typed)
- Your AI/ML + customer support background positions you for mid-level TypeScript roles

**Verdict:** Learn TypeScript FIRST through React/Next.js

---

### Why RAG over Agentic AI? ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (PERFECT FIT)

**Why RAG First:**
- **Foundation for agentic AI** - Learn retrieval before agents
- **Easier to explain** in interviews - "Semantic search + generation"
- **Faster to build** - 8-12 weeks vs 12-16 weeks
- **Production-proven pattern** - Every company wants RAG
- **Leverages graduate AI/ML** - Shows education wasn't theoretical

**Why Not Agentic AI (Yet):**
- More complex (tool use, planning, memory, error handling)
- Harder to demonstrate value in interviews
- Better learned with mentor guidance on the job

**Career Changer Advantage:**
- Most developers: No AI/ML education
- Most AI/ML grads: No web development skills
- **You have both** = Unique market position

**Verdict:** Build RAG project now, add agentic features later (phase 2) or as side project after landing job

---

### Why Vercel/Railway over AWS? ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (STRATEGIC)

**Vercel + Railway Advantages:**
- **Deploy in minutes** vs AWS hours/days
- **Zero DevOps overhead** - Focus on application code
- **Modern developer experience** - Git push = deploy
- **Free tier sufficient** for portfolio projects
- **Impressive in interviews** - "Production deployed" matters more than AWS logo

**AWS Later:**
- Add AWS features after MVP (S3, Lambda, etc.)

## 💡 Alternative Path: Agentic AI Project

**If you want Agentic AI instead of RAG:**

### Project Idea: AI Coding Assistant for BACnet Protocol

**Why This Works:**
- Combines BACnet domain knowledge from internship
- Demonstrates agentic AI (tool use, planning, memory)
- More impressive than RAG (fewer people can build this)
- Natural extension of your internship project

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js + TypeScript (same frontend)
- LangChain/LangGraph for agent orchestration
- OpenAI function calling for tools
- BACnet operations as agent tools
- Cloud deployment (Vercel + Railway)

**Example Agent Capabilities:**
- Read BACnet documentation (RAG from docs)
- Generate BACnet read/write commands
- Explain BACnet object types
- Debug BACnet communication errors
- Suggest device configuration

**Trade-offs:**
- ⏱️ **More time:** 12-16 weeks vs 8-12 weeks
- 🧠 **Harder to explain** in interviews (agents are complex)
- ⭐ **Much more impressive** if done well
- 🎯 **Narrower use case** (BACnet-specific vs general KB)

**Recommendation:** Build RAG first, then add agentic features as "phase 2" or future enhancement

---

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### Don't Fall Into These Traps:

1. **Perfectionism Paralysis**
   - Ship MVP in 8 weeks, iterate later
   - "Good enough deployed" > "Perfect in progress"
   - Live URL matters more than perfect code

2. **Tutorial Hell**
   - Build YOUR project, not tutorial projects
   - Reference tutorials, don't follow blindly
   - Your KB project is unique to your domain

3. **Feature Creep**
   - Stick to 8-12 week plan
   - Advanced features can wait until after job search
   - Focus on deployment + portfolio polish

4. **Ignoring Deployment**
   - Deploy to Vercel in Week 1 (even if just "Hello World")
   - Deploy backend in Week 8 (not Week 12)
   - Early deployment = less risk, more iteration

### Success Factors:

1. ✅ **Ship to production** - Live URLs prove you can deploy
2. ✅ **Write domain expertise story** - Customer support + AI = unique
3. ✅ **Deploy early, iterate often** - Don't wait 12 weeks
4. ✅ **Document as you build** - README, screenshots, architecture
5. ✅ **Test on real users** - Ask friends to try your KB search
